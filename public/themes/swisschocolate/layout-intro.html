  <h1>Swiss Chocolate</h1>
  <p>A rich chocolate theme for webdoc. A refined, elegant and luxurious theme, a molten, dripping, and tantalisingly rich and sweet theme for webdoc. A theme that makes you salivate. It's so dangerously yummy you could eat it. Lick it. Taste it.</p>
  <!--p>Either that, or it will remind you of hotel lobbies, gilded elevators, background musak and cheesy waiters. Everything and anything inauthentic, polished to look classy, </p-->
  <p>I won't eat it, of course. I'll resist. If I ate it, you wouldn't be able to see it, and that, really, is the whole purpose of it being here. Besides that, I don't think my stomach could digest the components of my LCD screen. Not without causing me some pain, at any rate. Perhaps when I was younger. Anyway, I digress.</p>
  <p>Swiss chocolate is a test theme. There's a whole bunch of special typography, using text-indents and CSS generated content, background images and padding on the content boxes.</p>
