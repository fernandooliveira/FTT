/* states.css
 * 
 * Takes care of the state classes:
 *
 *   .loading     - State of items requested from a server
 *   .active      - Implies polar (on/off) state
 *   .state-xxx   - Implies multipolar (0/1/2/...) state
 *   .mode-xxx    - Implies multipolar (0/1/2/...) state
 *   .current     - Current implies that one out of a number of items is the current one
 * 
 * State classes must NOT have default style applied, they are there to indicate state only.
 * You can style specific nodes that happen to have state, or children of state nodes (for
 * instance, showing / hiding a .loading-icon when its parent has .loading), but the state
 * class itself must not have global style applied.
